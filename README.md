# smart-pointers
Own implementation of such C++ standard library features as unique/shared/weak pointers and enable_shared_from_this. Specifically, unique pointer implementation uses compressed_pair class template and EOB technique. Includes cpp-file tests. It is from my C++ university course. It is fundamentals of writing in C++ in some sense.
